# My Syncro Scripts is a repository I just created to share scripts I've written with the SyncroMSP community.  These are free to use and distribute.  All I ask is that the credits remain in the script.

All scripts are PowerShell scripts so just copy and paste into your Syncro Script editor and set the script type as PowerShell.

Enjoy!
